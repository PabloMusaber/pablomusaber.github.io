# Telegram Bot <a href="https://github.com/PabloMusaber/telegram-bot-noticias" style="color: #6c757d" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#333333'" onMouseOut="this.style.color='#6c757d'" target="githubWindow"><i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>

This bot responds to commands sent through the chat and was used to obtain the main news from Xataka, iProUP, and Infobae from **web scraping** scripts. It is currently not deployed because I no longer use it.

The news can be requested by interacting with the buttons that appear with the command **"/noticias"**.

By clicking on any of the buttons, the list of titles of the latest news of the selected site is obtained, in the same way that occurs when using the commands. Clicking on any of the titles opens a tab of the default browser with the specified news.

In addition, with the **"/help"** command, you get information about the bot.
